Some explanations:
- Nodemon is a utility that monitors for changes in files in your Node.js application 
and automatically restarts the server when it detects any changes. 
It's particularly useful during development because it saves you from having to manually stop 
and restart your server every time you make a change in your code.

- Morgan is a popular HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js. 
It's used to log information about incoming requests in your Node.js application. 
This middleware can be easily integrated with Express.js, although it can also be used with other Node.js web frameworks.
